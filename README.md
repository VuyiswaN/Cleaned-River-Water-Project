# Cleaned-River-Water-Project
This project aims to analyze water quality data collected from a polluted river in Buenos Aires. The dataset contains various water parameters such as turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), and hardness, among others. The goal is to clean and preprocess the data, identify trends, and make it ready for further analysis or modeling.

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of river water quality data collected from various water parameters. The data was extracted from the river, taken to a chemical lab, and manually recorded. The main objectives of the project are to:
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships and trends.
- Prepare the dataset for further analysis and machine learning modeling.

## Data Collection
The dataset was obtained by extracting water samples from the polluted river in Buenos Aires. These samples were analyzed in a chemical lab to determine various water quality indicators, including turbidity, hardness, TSS, and more.

## Data Cleaning
The raw dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and ensure that all data entries are consistent. This process included:
- Handling missing numerical values.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Standardizing column names and ensuring the dataset was structured correctly.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to:
- Understand the distribution of key variables.
- Visualize correlations between features.
- Detect outliers and anomalies in the dataset.
  
Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps were used to identify trends and patterns in the data.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps included:
- Scaling of numerical variables for consistency.
- Encoding of categorical variables, if necessary.
- Preparing the data for machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** for data preprocessing
