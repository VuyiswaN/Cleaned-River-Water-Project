# Cleaned-River-Water-Project
This project aims to analyze water quality data collected from a polluted river in Buenos Aires. The dataset contains various water parameters such as turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), and hardness, among others. The goal is to clean and preprocess the data, identify trends, and make it ready for further analysis or modeling.
